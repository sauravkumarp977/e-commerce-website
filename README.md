This is a fully responsive web app developed using techs like HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, React.js, Strapi CMS & Stripe.

I have added some basic features in this web app like selecting on any product would take the user to a page where it gonna show the user how many of that product he/she can buy,
by increasing or decreasing the number.
The bellow part of that page will show the related products of the product that the user has selected before.
And then on tapping the 'Add to cart' button will show the user a right bar where the user can see the total price according to the quantity that user increased or decreased and can buy the product by tapping on 'checkout' button.
After that the user will get a payment form validation page where the user can fill the details and can buy the product successfully.
And there is a search option through which the user can search by typing the product name or letter and the search bar will filter all the products matches to the product names or letters that has been typed on search bar.
There are some of pictures of my web app right bellow:
